# Resume Points for Doc-Whisperer Project

Here are a few options for your resume, tailored for a Full Stack Developer role. Choose the one that best fits the space you have and the specific job requirements.

## Option 1: Balanced (Focus on Full Stack & AI)
**Project: AI-Powered Document Assistant (RAG Application)**
*   Built a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application enabling users to chat with PDF/DOCX documents using **Spring Boot** and **React**.
*   Implemented a high-performance backend with **LangChain4j** for vector embeddings and **Apache Tika** for document parsing, integrated with **Ollama** for local LLM inference.
*   Architected a scalable vector search solution using **PostgreSQL** with **pgvector**, optimizing semantic retrieval accuracy.
*   Designed a modern, responsive frontend with **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn UI**, featuring real-time chat and document management.

## Option 2: Technical Deep Dive (Focus on Backend & Architecture)
**Project: Doc-Whisperer - Enterprise Document Chat Engine**
*   Developed a secure document analysis platform using **Java 21 (Spring Boot)**, leveraging **Docker** for containerized database management (**PostgreSQL/pgvector**).
*   Engineered an end-to-end RAG pipeline: handled multi-format file ingestion, chunking, vectorization, and semantic search to ground LLM responses in user data.
*   Solved complex integration challenges including custom bean configuration for **LangChain4j** and optimizing JDBC/Vector Store connections.
*   Created RESTful APIs to serve a **React/Vite** frontend, ensuring seamless data flow and error handling.

## Option 3: Concise (Action-Oriented)
**Project: Full Stack RAG Chat Application**
*   **Tech Stack:** Java Spring Boot, React (TypeScript), PostgreSQL (pgvector), LangChain4j, Docker, Ollama.
*   Developed a "Chat with your Data" application allowing semantic search over uploaded documents.
*   Implemented vector storage and retrieval logic, connecting a local LLM to a custom knowledge base.
*   Built a polished UI for document uploads and interactive chat, handling asynchronous state and real-time updates.

## Key Skills & Technologies to Highlight
*   **Languages:** Java (Spring Boot), TypeScript (React)
*   **AI/ML Engineering:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Vector Databases (pgvector), Embeddings, LLM Integration (Ollama/LangChain4j).
*   **Data & Infrastructure:** PostgreSQL, Docker, REST APIs, JDBC.
*   **Frontend:** Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, State Management.
